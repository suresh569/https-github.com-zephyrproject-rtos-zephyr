  STM32 flash memory. This binding is for the flash memory itself, not
  the flash controller peripheral. For that, see the
  "st,stm32-flash-controller" binding.

include: soc-nv-flash.yaml

compatible: st,stm32-nv-flash

properties:
  max-erase-time:
    type: int
    description: max erase time(millisecond) of a flash sector or page or half-page
    required: true
  bank2-flash-size:
    type: int
    description: |
      This property defines the size in KB of the embedded flash memory bank2. This
      is needed since M4 CPU to which bank2 is allocated doesn't have access to flash
      controller register to read the size. This provides a way to configure this
      size when the flash controller driver runs on the M4 CPU.
