  Worldsemi WS2812 LED strip, UART binding

  Driver bindings for controlling a WS2812 or compatible LED
  strip with a UART.

  The UART driver should be usable as long as a zephyr UART API driver is available for your
  board and has tx-invert property available and enabled.

  Data serialisation explanation for WS2812:
  3 pulses/bits of UART are used to represent one bit of RGB data. During the development of this
  driver, I was using an ESP32C3 MCU with its UART baud rate set to 2.5Mbits per sec. Hence, 1
  bit equals 400ns. For WS2812 timing details, please refer to its datasheet.

  We need to carefully analyse the pulse timing requirements of ws2812 ic or any other ic in
  order to construct Logic 0, Logic 1 frame, rgb-frame-per-uart-frame (Total number of RGB data
  bits send per UART transaction) and frame-len(bits to represent single rgb bit).

  For WS2812:-                       ___
  Logic 0 frame-> 0x4 or 0b100 ->  _| 1 |_0__0_
                                     ______
  Logic 1 frame-> 0x6 or 0b110 ->  _| 1  1 |_0_

  rgb-frame-per-uart-frame -> 3 (3 RGB data bits will be send per per uart transaction)
  frame-len -> 3 (3 UART bits needed to represent 1 RGB bit)

  Calculation will be done using these node properties to build a lookup table using C macros
  automatically. And that lookup-table will be used to feed the actual UART buffer which
  will be send to WS2812 ic.
