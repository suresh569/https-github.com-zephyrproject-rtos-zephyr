      Reference to a PWM instance.

      The period field is used by the set_brightness function of the
      Backlight-PWM API.
      Its value should at least be greater than 100 nanoseconds (for a full
      brigtness granularity) and lesser than 50 milliseconds (average visual
      persistence time of the human eye). Typical values for the PWM period
      are 10 or 20 milliseconds.
