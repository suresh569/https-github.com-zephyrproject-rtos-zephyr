  WIZnet WIZ550io - W5500 Ethernet controller.
  WIZ550io contains a W5500 Ethernet controller with an extra PIC12F519 MCU.
  The PIC12F519 MCU initialises the W5500 with a unique MAC address after a
  GPIO reset. The unique MAC address is used if neither
  "zephyr,random-mac-address" or "local-mac-address" properties are
  configured in the corresponding W5500 device.

      Reset pin (active low output).
      The reset-gpios property must be assigned to WIZ550io rather than
      the W5500 device. The hardware reset pin is required for WIZ550io,
      as a software reset of W5500 will clear the MAC address assigned
      by the PIC12F519.
  ready-gpios:

      Ready pin (active high input).
      Optional GPIO pin that signals when the PIC12F519 has finished
      configuring the W5500. Enabling this reduces the 150ms delay
      after GPIO reset.
