description: Xilinx Zynq (XC7Zxxx/XC7ZxxxS) PS7 clock control

compatible: "xlnx,ps7-clkc"

include: [clock-controller.yaml, base.yaml]

properties:
  reg:
    required: true

  ps-clk-frequency:
    required: true
    type: int
    description: |
      Clock frequency of the external crystal, typically 33.3 MHz.

  fclk-enable:
    type: int
    description: |
      FPGA clocks enable bit mask (FCLK3/2/1/0, 0 = LSB).

  clock-output-names:
    required: true
    type: string-array
    description: |
      Names of all clocks managed by the clock control driver.
      The 'clocks' property of any associated peripheral node
      in the device tree references the corresponding index
      within this array.

  clocks:
    description: |
      Optional array of references to fixed-clock nodes via
      which EMIO clocks for peripherals that support EMIO as
      clock input source are specified. For each EMIO input
      clock specified via this array, a matching entry must
      exist in the clock-names array.

  clock-names:
    description: |
      Optional array of name strings for the EMIO input clock
      references contained in the 'clocks' array. For each
      entry in the 'clocks' array, a matching name string must
      be specified at the same array index herein. The EMIO input
      clock data is associated with its respective peripheral
      via the name string. The following name strings are supported:
        * "gem0_emio_clk"
        * "gem1_emio_clk"
        * "dbg_trc_emio_clk"

  syscon:
    type: phandle
    required: true
    description: |
      phandle to the syscon driver for the System Level Control
      Registers (SLCR) register space, which contains the clock
      control registers at offset 0x100.
