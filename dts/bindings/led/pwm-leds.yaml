        Reference to a PWM instance.

        The period field is used by the set_brightness function of the LED API.
        Its value should at least be greater that 100 nanoseconds (for a full
        brightness granularity) and lesser than 50 milliseconds (average visual
        persistence time of the human eye). Typical values for the PWM period
        are 10 or 20 milliseconds.
