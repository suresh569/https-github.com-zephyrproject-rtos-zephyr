menuconfig CLOCK_MGMT
	bool "Clock management drivers"
	help
	  Enable support for clock management drivers. These drivers provide
	  clock configuration to the system via a series of setpoints, which
	  allow drivers to configure clocks based on their desired power
	  state

source "subsys/logging/Kconfig.template.log_config"

config CLOCK_MGMT_SET_RATE
	bool "Support runtime rate setting"
	help
	  Allow clock consumers to request a given clock frequency via the
	  clock management framework. The framework will then configure the
	  clock tree so that the consumer is supplied with the closest
	  possible frequency to its request. Note that enabling this feature
	  will result in increased flash utilization

config CLOCK_MGMT_NOTIFY
	bool "Support clock rate change notifications"
	help
	  Support clock rate change notifications. When enabled, clock
	  consumers can register for a callback when the frequency of their
	  output clock changes.

config CLOCK_MGMT_FIXED_SOURCE
	bool "Fixed clock source driver"
	default y
	depends on DT_HAS_FIXED_CLOCK_SOURCE_ENABLED
	help
	  Fixed clock source driver, for non configurable clock sources

config CLOCK_MGMT_OUTPUT
	bool "Output clock driver"
	default y
	depends on DT_HAS_CLOCK_OUTPUT_ENABLED
	help
	  Output clock driver. Allows users to request clock rates directly
	  when support is enabled by the clock management subsystem
